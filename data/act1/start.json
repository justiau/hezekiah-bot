Society completely idolizes money and have abandoned all goodness and wellbeing. Your goal as Prime Minister is to reestablish the Republic of Jooduh to its former glory and bring back the goodness and wellbeing of its citizens, as a shining beacon of hope in a sea of desperate power hungry neighbours.  You wake up to a slightly dark day, the skies are cloudy and the birds are quiet. After having your customary drink of Ceylon black tea, you put on your shoes and head outside. Where would you like to go?",
