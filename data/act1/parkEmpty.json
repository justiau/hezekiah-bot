You walk around trying to slowly come to some internal peace but you’re interrupted by a stranger coming towards you in the distance. You consider walking in the other direction but what kind of Prime Minister would do that? “Looking for some Milo man? I got plenty if you wanna.” He looked older than he was, the ripped black jeans and a pink faded hoodie covering his skeleton of a body. The boy looks disheveled, his hair wispy white, from stress, from living on the streets or just from the consumption of Milo, a brown unassuming powder that has plagued Jooduh for generations. You respond:",
